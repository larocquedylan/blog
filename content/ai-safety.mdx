AI safety comes down ot what exactly? How should one think about developing these tools in a way that is robust and beautiful?

Is it whether these architectures and fundamental models are open sources or guarded by trusted authorities?

At base, AI is scary. Intelligence is scary. So there has to be some thought as to how we should live with this new entity. There is an arugment to be made that these tools should never have been created in the first place. I get get down with this. But. They have been.

So where do we go from here? In my perspective, AI should not be guarded. It should be open sourced. Give the means to production to everyone. It is my view that there is more good than bad. And the good will always outweight the bad. The hope is open source and the good actors can counter act the bad actors. This is the natural order of things.

When it is gated, the distrbution is smaller, more volatile, and the odds of a bad actor controlling the means is much higher.

** so open source it **.
