acceleration is the only thing that lifted humanity out of poverty. you have to make the pie bigger. 

People say it is how the wealth is distributed. It really is not. The more you think about how wealth is distributed. The less you are thinking about how to create more wealth. 

Genie Coefficient vs. The GDP. 

Being optimist isn't naivety that everything will work out perfectly. Acceleration isn't a utopia. But it recognizes that more things will go in our favour than against if we accelerate. 

Does accelerating increase or decrease entropy?
