## Some Preamble...

Nostalgia is a powerful force. Recently, I've found myself playing Xbox with childhood friends, thanks to a loaned console from Seigfred, friend of the blog. What started as a casual throwback quickly evolved into something more.

I've always been competitive. As I improved at the games, I began to see the Xbox's limitations. The frame rates felt restrictive, a bottleneck to my progress. I am currently a diamond rank, but would like to see if I could get to Crimson next season.

This has me thinking about building my own PC. I've tinkered with Raspberry Pis before, but a full-scale build presents a different challenge. It's not just about gaming performance; it's an opportunity to deepen my understanding of software, hardware, and the dance between them.

The project excites me as a learning experience, but I'm wary of my impatience. There's a tension between my eagerness to use the finished product and the need for careful, methodical work that not only saves some dollars because I am bit restricted, but also wanting to learn as much as possible about the parts that go into a PC.

My current job at a the Shaugnessy golf course on the grounds crew - beautiful as it is - sits in stark contrast to my previous role as a software engineer. So I am looking for a hands-on project to keep my skills sharp.

## What I am looking for

The best projects often start with a humble admission: I don't know what I don't know.

My digital activities span multiple domains: music production, programming, and gaming. Each of these has its own technical demands. My recently upgraded MacBook serves me well for coding. But, I loosely follow George Hotz and he built this _[tinybox](https://tinygrad.org/)_ PC that he is selling. It's a beast designed to make it possible for everyone to train and run inference for LLM models on their own private machine. A romantic idea for a DIY type like myself. So while programming isn't my focus for this machine, I'm not entirely closing the door on future upgrades.

The PC I'm planning to build, then, isn't meant to be a jack-of-all-trades. Instead, it will serve a focused purpose: a dedicated media hub and streaming station.

I am green to building a PC. So I need to define the problem space a bit before jumping into solutions.

A few initial questions I have:

1. What are the typical mistakes first-time builders make?
2. Where do performance bottlenecks usually occur in systems designed for streaming and media playback?
3. How do I balance current needs with potential future upgrades?
4. What are the critical components for a smooth streaming experience?

Looking at the tinybox info and I see the following dimensions

TFLOPS
GPU RAM
GPU RAM bandwidth
GPU link bandwidth
CPU
System RAM
System RAM bandwidth
Disk size
Disk read bandwidth
Networking
Noise
Power Supply
BMC
Operating System
Dimensions
Driver Quality
Price

So I think this is a good jumping off point for understanding which vectors to optimize.

I also foud this youtube video that has tons of views and subs so I will give a watch: [linus tech tips - pc building guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1fxZ-VWs2U)
