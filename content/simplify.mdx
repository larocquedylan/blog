Our life is frittered away by detail. . . . Simplify, simplify. — Henry David Thoreau, Walden (1854)

_Nature_ uses only the _longest_ threads to weave her patterns, so that each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry. — Richard Feynman, 




There seems, to me, that everything can be simplified and this is what humans constantly seek. 

If you want to know why a particle took that path. Look at all the possible paths it could have taken and you will see it is the shortest. 

The more links we have the stronger the foundation. Why is this? 

Less attack vectors. The more centralized something is, the easier it is to corrupt. why?
