Having completed my internship at Microsoft, I'm taking a moment to reflect on insights I've gathered. This experience offered me a firsthand view of how industry leaders function. My aim here is to share my evolving philosophy, methods, and perspectives shaped by this internship. I hope these reflections resonate and provide valuable guidance, particularly for those just beginning their journey in the tech world.

### 1. Growth Mindset

**Microsoft values a Growth Mindset** highly. To me, this signifies staying optimistic and understanding that solving problems is a step-by-step journey. It starts with grasping the basics, hypothesizing solutions, and finally, working through them. Accept that bugs are clashes between your model and reality; reality always wins. Appreciate that learning is filled with guesses, attempts, setbacks, and course corrections.

It's vital to realize that changing interests toward different issues or sub-issues is critical to the creative process. Embrace the unpredictability of the future because this will fuel a mindset of endless learning. Most importantly, maintain an optimistic outlook. Your actions and thoughts shape what's ahead, and this optimism stems from the capacity to identify and fix mistakes.

### 2. Go to the Office

**Hit the office**. Try arriving earlier than others. Despite Microsoft's flexible work options, there's a unique charm in an empty office. There is a charm to a large, empty office. A white noise is produced that's soothing to the ears. It's peaceful, with fewer distractions, allowing you to ease into your day thoughtfully.

Being in the office also sparks spontaneous interactions with your team. Use these chances to connect with as many colleagues as possible. Make your presence known and valued. Demonstrate your eagerness to contribute to the team's success. Be cheerful and constructive.

### 3. Find a Mentor

**Mentorship is vital**. As a junior, it's on you to hunt for mentorship. Watch your peers closely. The best mentors are the ones who naturally ask probing questions and enjoy teaching.

Aim to connect with someone who makes you look forward to interactions. Your ideal mentor should challenge you, especially during code reviews, and actively engage with your thoughts. The real gold is finding someone patient, skilled, and able to play an oracle in the codebase.

Observe how they tackle problems, the questions they pose, and their strategy for finding answers. This insight is invaluable.

### 4. Create a Personal Log

**Document Everything**. Much like how computers work, writing costs more than reading. Everyone knows that the most valuable free and open-source software in the world is the English language. Play with the API. Regular documentation sharpens your thinking and builds a valuable resource for career moves like performance reviews, resume updates, or interview prep.

When you hit a technical snag, break it down in simple terms and draw diagrams if needed. Set up a system for your notes. Include code snippets, insights from Stack Overflow or GitHub, and takeaways. Frame the problem in everyday language to crystal-clear your understanding and direct your solution search.

Often, the real challenge is grasping the issue itself. Writing focuses your problem-solving lens. If you're still stuck and need to consult another developer, your notes will have the context that makes for quicker, sharper feedback from them.

### 5. How to Ask Good Questions

**Asking good questions** will demonstrate the attitude that leads to competence - eager, thoughtful, observant. So, relax and give the problem some thought.

The quality of responses you receive will largely depend on how you frame your questions. The more specific your query (provide a pointer, send code, etc.), the more valuable the response. It also gives them a gauge of how much energy they will need to invest in helping, which is pleasant for everyone. Do your best to anticipate the questions an engineer will ask and answer them in advance in your request for help. Engineers are drawn to challenging problems and well-framed, thought-provoking questions.

**So before asking for help...**

1. Read documentation and examples relevant to the problem.
    
2. Examine the relevant source code.
    
3. If another team uses the tool in the org, see how it is implemented in that repo.
    
4. Search GitHub issues if it is an open-source tool.
    
5. Look at the web. Use specific titles like "X - deviation from Y," where X describes the main object, and Y is the abnormal behaviour.  
    

**Show you've done the work** by displaying what you have _learned_ from doing these things.

- Describe your goal.
    
- Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.
    
- Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, version, etc.).
    
- Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem
    
- Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem
    
- Show them! Let them watch how you interact with the software and its outputs in response to your inputs. This is one of the benefits of being **in the office**; there is just less friction.
    

Lastly, avoid things like: 'I know I'm so green, but...". This is unhelpful. It is usually indicative of laziness in thinking and coupled with vagueness about the actual problem.

### 7. Create a Sandbox First

**Build an MVP first**. It's good practice when adding new features to your codebase. Instead of jumping headfirst and patching directly in the main repo, start with a mini-test app.

This approach strips away complexities, sharpening your grasp of the tool or package before integrating it into the main codebase. There are fewer moving pieces, and the problems are more isolated. Once your test app works reliably, you can migrate the functionality to the actual application. This method is beneficial because if the package doesn't mesh well, the problem space is much smaller. You'll know the issue lies in your implementation, not the package or library itself.

### 8. Code Review is Tight

**Think of Pull Requests** as your training ground. Craft them like engaging white papers, something people want to read and engage with, make them a pleasure for others to review. Each PR should be clear-cut and concise.

First, your program should be of quality to merge. Be sure the linting problems are all solved. Have good names for bindings. Remove any unneeded comments. Make the code clean.

Then, do your write-up. Start with a descriptive title and a link to the task. Give a brief rundown of the PR's objective. Include screenshots and code snippets where necessary. Detail the components you've worked on or introduced, and explain your choices.

Crucially, pinpoint the areas needing meticulous review and justify why. This sharp focus maximizes the value of the review process and sharpens your programming chops.

Remember, a simple 'Please' and 'Thank you' acknowledging the reviewers' effort and time goes a long way.

### 8. A Task Expands to the Time Given to It

**Deadlines drive efficiency,** a truth borrowed from queueing theory. Avoid overestimating the time for bug fixes, PR completions, or small projects. Choose tight deadlines. Let the angst push you. If you allocate a week for a task and find yourself still searching on day five, that urgency will fuel your progress. I promise.

It's akin to budgeting in accounting. Straying too far over or under your time budget indicates a forecasting error. Tight deadlines help refine both your predictions and productivity. Which makes you a more reliable team member.

### 9. Share Your Passions Outside of the Office

**Talk about your hobbies at work**. I like making beats and rhymes. Initially, I hesitated to bring this up in a professional environment, but it came up. I am glad it did, too. Colleagues responded positively, eager to hear my stuff and share their hobbies. Some had created tools decades ago that are now the main value propositions of entire organizations today. Others have been refining a simulator for years, hacking more as computing power increases. And some who dive deep into crafting their own gin and tonics.

There's something special about hearing people discuss what they love doing, not for money, but for the sheer pleasure of it. It adds a human touch to the workplace and fosters deeper connections.

### 10. Picking Side Projects

**Focus on making tools when learning**. Pick side projects that captivate you, things you find fun or would personally use. This approach drives you deeper into the subject, and all the exciting things happen in the tails.

You'll have average results if you choose a project solely because it uses a stack favoured by a specific company. It's taken me a couple of years to realize that new packages and frameworks are like annual trophies in a competition. Everyone vies for them. Instead, invest your time in exploring uncharted territories. That's where you'll find the real treasures.

And that's a wrap, everyone - my top 10 takeaways. If any part of this post sparked your interest, I'd be grateful if you shared it or left a comment. I'm currently navigating the job market; LinkedIn applications feel like a black hole, my previous team at Microsoft is still on a hiring freeze, and big man's got to eat.

  

I want to WORK, and my greatest gift is my team spirit.
