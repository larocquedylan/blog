I cofounded a failed venture in my last year at Uni. We attracted an impressive team of advisors. 3 of the most talented engineers at the school. A beach head established and willing customers to purchase the thing if we could build it. A longer term roadmap that the incubator was excited about.

We couldn't build it tho. I was the marketing lead for the team and this humbling. I knew the thing that stood between us and our vision was something I was simply incapable of contributing to in any meaningful fashion in the time needed. We folded after the 8 months of hacking.

I learned I needed to build rather than sell.

Here is why...

Marketing is simply communication. It is a practice of empathy. If you have done your research, you know there is a group of people large enough that have some common thread. And that this thing you are offering to the cosmos is the exact thing they need. It will relieve pains, create gains, and should likely do both if you want to grow. It was made for these people precisely.

The question becomes: how do you make your audience care? How do you craft a compelling story to get people to part with their hard earned dollars for some shmuchks. Why should they believe that they thing you are offering will be of more value than the money you are asking for in return?

I guess it could be free. But even then, why should they use your free option. There are no free lunches.

It is in communicating. Communication is the message, but we know that the medium is the message. How to get your ideas to them in a place that they want to spend time. In a way that they are receptive to by talking about the things that are important to them. At a time that is convenient for them.

That requires understanding of them at a deep level. Knowing their constraints and capacities. Talk with them!

But here is the thing, when you really look at consumer behaviour. You see it is crap shoot. Don't listen to what others say. Humans are not cognitive misers. Some may be, but those aren't the true fans you want. They aren't sustainable partners in what you are trying to do. Why people make the decisions they do is irreducible.

Physics is pretty well defined in that we know lots of the forces we are working with, around, and against. The space is reducible and all problems are soluble unless banned by the laws we have at the moment.

So see the invisible hand, understand the limits to your physical environment. Build the thing you need. Learn as much as you can. Sharpen your toolkit. Make yourself a big target for luck and the powers that by being as much as you can.

That is what this twitter is in essence. I've done a lot of grabbing my lunch pale and hard hat everyday for the last 2 years. Going from 0 to n with TypeScript skills, assimilating some engineering perspectives with my product focussed lens, and understanding my new customer (the computer).

Building trust is hard. I need capital. I have energy to contribute and I am creating more energy everyday. I just finished an internship with @microsoft. I need someone to give me a chance and a resume plus one page cover letter doesn't do it as good but green developer in this macroeconomic landscape. Team is currently on a hiring freeze, so am waiting to hear back. But here we go. Here are some perspectives so hopefully someone sees this repo and wants to ride this star.
