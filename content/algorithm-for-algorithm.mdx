1. **Identify Basic Operations:** Determine the basic operation of the algorithm, which is the most significant in terms of time consumption. This could be a comparison in a sorting algorithm, or a multiplication in a matrix operation.
    
2. **Counting the Operations:** Estimate the number of times the basic operation is executed. This often depends on the size of your input, denoted as 'n'. For example, in a simple for-loop from 1 to n, the basic operation is executed n times.
    
3. **Big O Notation:** Express the time complexity in terms of Big O notation. This notation abstracts away constants and lower-order terms to focus on the dominant term that grows the fastest as the input size increases. For example, O(n), O(n^2), O(log n).
    
4. **Nested Loops and Multiple Structures:** Pay attention to nested loops and multiple structures in your algorithm. The overall complexity is often the product of the complexities of each nested structure.
    
5. **Best, Worst, and Average Cases:** Consider different cases. The worst-case complexity is often quoted, but the best and average case can also provide valuable insights.
    
6. **Space Complexity:** Analyze the amount of memory space your algorithm needs relative to the input size. This includes variables, data structures, and function call stack.
    
7. **Amortized Analysis (if applicable):** In some cases, youâ€™ll want to look at the average time per operation over a sequence of operations, which is where amortized analysis comes in handy.
    
8. **Master Theorem (for recursive algorithms):** If dealing with recursive algorithms, the Master Theorem can be a quick way to get the complexity without having to expand the entire recursion tree.
