## Executive Summary

Focus is a product under development for the automotive industry, which seeks to replace rear-view mirrors with a rear-view LCD display to present an unobstructed wide-angle view of the rear of the vehicle. In contrast to existing market alternatives, Focus displays an image which has been focused at infinity, meaning the video feed showing the exterior of the car appears at the same focal distance as the car’s surrounding environment.

### Problem

Blindspots are areas of view not covered by conventional side-view and rear-view mirrors; additional hazards associated with mirror use are obstructions within the vehicle and headlight glare. In order to reduce these hazards the automotive industry in 2016 began producing rear view LCD displays to increase the field of view for the driver, reduce headlight glare and circumvent backseat obstructions. The issue with these new display product lines is that the displayed image is not clearly visible while the drivers eyes are focused on the road. Additionally, according to a Market Scope report 1 in 3 drivers on the roads suffer from presbyopia otherwise known as farsightedness. If a consumer with presbyopia were to use a new enhanced rear view display while driving their experience would range from non-functioning to increased amount of time needed to refocusing their vision when switching between looking at the road and the display.

### Product

Focus enhances automotive safety by eliminating blind-spots and enabling peripheral awareness of the car’s surroundings, in addition it is the first product that would enable the over 110 million Americans who suffer from farsightedness to benefit from the growing adoption of automotive camera displays by car manufacturers.

### Competitors

There are currently three competing solutions for observing the environment behind a forward-moving vehicle. Conventional mirrors possess issues regarding field of view and available line of sight. Head-up displays solve the problems of conventional mirrors but their presence can obstruct the drivers view of the road. Enhanced rear view displays solve the problems of heads-up displays and convention mirrors but the useability of the device is inhibited by its dependence on good fission and it’s unnaturally focused image.

### Revenue Model

Product sales are the main revenue stream for Focus. The beachhead sales revenue is estimated at $38.3m with a gross margin of $5.7m at the price tag of $15,000 per unit. For the general market, sales revenue is estimated at $4.08b with a gross margin of $1.02b at the price tag of $1199 per unit. In the commercial fleet market, the Focus is in progress of further research and validation to capture accurate price and sales volume estimates.

### Market Size

The market for automotive camera displays is expected to grow from $8.96 to $12 billion from 2017 - 2022. Our beachhead market size of race car drivers is set to be at $22.5 million, while market size for North American drivers with severe presbyopia is $84 million, the global market for drivers with severe presbyopia is $332 million and the global camera based displays is $12 billion.

### Go-to-Market

The automotive industry is tight knit and difficult to penetrate, therefore in order to approach being incorporated into mass production vehicles we require increased credibility. In order to gain this credibility we plan to first target and associate with the Ferrari and Grand Tour racing series. In associating with the racing series we aim to accomplish a proof of concept or stress test for our technology by displaying its function in a high risk environment. As we begin to gain traction into the world’s racing series we plan on focusing our attention on North America’s commercial bus fleets in an attempt to display our product as safety centred and showcase our ability to manufacture on a larger scale. After after displaying a stress test of our technology and proving our manufacturing abilities we plan to bring this technology to a tier 1 supplier with the goal of the incorporation into an internal design that will then be offered and accepted by a general market automobile manufacturer and will subsequently be sold to the mass market.

Focus’ initial target user is race car drivers but their final target user is the safety conscious parent who is looking for an unobstructed line of sight and an increased field of view of their surroundings.

### What we need

Currently, we are looking to raise $960,000 to finance our R&D costs, salaries, and to supplement our marketing programs as we continue to build our brand recognition and develop a general consumer market ready product.

## The Problem

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and NCBI: Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, every single year there are over 800,000 accidents, 300 deaths and $110 billion in economic harm generated from blindspot related accidents in the United States. Blind spots are areas of view not covered by conventional side-view and rear-view mirrors; additional hazards associated with mirror use are obstructions within the vehicle and headlight glare. In order to reduce these hazards the automotive industry in 2016 began producing rear view LCD displays to increase the field of view for the driver, reduce headlight glare and circumvent backseat obstructions. The issue with these new display product lines is that the displayed image is not clearly visible while the drivers eyes are focused on the road. Additionally, according to a Market Scope report 1 in 3 drivers on the roads suffer from presbyopia otherwise known as farsightedness. If a consumer with presbyopia were to use a new enhanced rear view display while driving their experience would range from non-functioning to increased amount of time needed to refocusing their vision when switching between looking at the road and the display.

## Validation

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/nJzFc25cBxbH9DEN-FIrrm6u2pFsvT74_psPoW4VCZEAu8cse5alQLymb1t3Ha1nus1C1jqQCUjve81InQwPAu_OXAHn44K7Uz2gmZ5Ro2pco3CzOitL1ODg_iRi8_B8FKHhQMn6QHy3qcEAp8cgdw)

Issues with the focal distance of rear-view displays and driver awareness of the road have yet to become a prominent headlines-grabbing problem as the adoption rate of these rear-view displays has been slow, after having been first introduced in 2016. Analogous to backup cameras, which have been mandated as a necessary feature in all production vehicles in North America by 2018, market reports expect the rapid growth of rear view displays as GM, Nissan, Toyota unroll this technology as a standard feature in mass-produced product lines.

In interviews with 14 ophthalmologists and 25 drivers we identified focal distance as a significant pain point of using the current rear view displays while driving, with users reporting the displays felt unnatural, uncomfortable, and unfamiliar to their driving instincts. Additionally, these problems become significantly compounded for the 1 in 3 drivers that suffers from presbyopia or far-sightedness, which reduces the ability to refocus one’s eyes. These problems are most acutely experienced by demographics with the most strenuous demands on driving ability and reaction time, therefore we interviewed two professional racecar drivers and one professional racecar engineer who both identified the focal aspect as the primary pain point in using rear view displays.

## Market Potential

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/RvNsZPdg77SuHlVvq3QjFeMEVg0KqVMLITdz4Cm-C1MgisDlkjvMVn8JkCN8MEo7PQgEOVhGOVNhHZ6PgE2SqTXNIGe1ckgQkgHk5crqQdwYLMemtTYwxChTqI53x-_GnpAMSA0F1Xglg2fl-phA4A)

The global rear-view camera market has an estimated market size of $12 Billion dollars. That comes out to about $1.58/person. When we consider that next year in 2020, 2.1 billion people worldwide will be afflicted with presbyopia and with a 10% awareness level, we have estimated our global serviceable market size to $332 million. Scaling this number down to the North American market, Focus as an obtainable market size of approximately $84 million dollars.

Looking at our beachhead market, there are currently two separate series we are targeting, each with 650 unique teams. With an already agreed upon price of $15,000 per unit, our project beachhead size is approximately $22.5 million in revenue with the opportunity to expand to adjacent serie and further develop our product offering.

## Our Product 

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/DdjkYw_2DQviB65KbKj9BjVaGeYQpGOrtTv_y5SLfW33CxDYHaY64d2MefvFn9oA7NUo0iFItHF_3oJ-4c_SNZWyzniw7j9nohQeDcd-VGdHudm7fWHqDFNaqvTVDD1skDDTTziL5Nf7ZHXwq9tBfQ)

The Focus display is an augmented LCD display which re-focuses its image to have the same focal depth as the surroundings of a vehicle, thereby providing an unobstructed and wide field of view of the exterior of a vehicle while maintaining the same ease-of-use and peripheral awareness as traditional mirrors. Additionally, Focus displays are capable of adapting dynamically to varying light conditions by reducing glare, enhancing contrast, and adapting to low-light conditions for night-time driving. The product replaces traditional rear-view mirrors and sits in the same location with comparable physical dimensions, presenting a wide angle view of the exterior of the car without relying on direct line-of-sight. The product will be available in both aftermarket additions and as options for manufacturers through tier one suppliers of automotive interior products. Competitive Advantage

## Competitive Distinction

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/AGuW_gzS3vt1sGngiJpY-nG22ig0sOZCJ98oQnCbcWqiSm5fvAfvy4nXj8VjbrKGcaMCmCILKYZEYNz8Do0mgTib3I881KpfqdCS-K58pKfqV7F-d16VV5kbsGM5Z-cZK1BCSg7cBCABhyUT0g0A2A)

There are currently three categories of competing solutions for observing the environment behind a forward-moving vehicle.

### Conventional Mirrors

Standard mirrors display an image at the same focal point as the surroundings of the car and are located in a position that does not directly obstruct the forward view of the driver. However, mirrors provide a restricted field of view of the rear of the vehicle of only 15 degrees, and rely on line-of-sight which may be blocked by cargo or passengers. Additionally mirrors redirect headlights from nearby cars into the drivers eyes, causing issues when driving at night.

### Heads-Up Displays

Heads-up displays have been introduced as a potential solution to increase the driver’s field of view, all while leaving the driver’s blind spots in scope. Unfortunately, these heads-up displays obstruct driver’s view of the road and can present uncomfortable sight lines for the drivers.

### Enhanced Rear View Displays

Enhanced rear view displays have been introduced to surpass both conventional mirrors and heads-up displays by increasing the field of view, allowing for an uninterrupted line of sight regardless of cargo load. Unlike mirrors, these enhanced rear view displays have a focal point different than that of the surroundings of the car, making them difficult for users with presbyopia and unnatural for all other drivers.

## Market Potential

The global rear-view camera market has an estimated market size of $12 Billion dollars. That comes out to about $1.58/person. When we consider that next year in 2020, 2.1 billion people worldwide will be afflicted with presbyopia and with a 10% awareness level, we have estimated our global serviceable market size to $332 million. Scaling this number down to the North American market, Focus as an obtainable market size of approximately $84 million dollars.

Looking at our beachhead market, there are currently two separate series we are tagretting, each with 650 unique teams. With an already agreed upon price of $15,000 per unit, our project beachhead size is approximately $22.5 million in revenue with the opportunity to expand to adjacent serie and further develop our product offering.

## Target Markets

### Beachhead

Race Car Drivers are both the users of the product and the economic buyer. They most acutely experience the pains of current LCD displays and are actively seeking new technologies to trim seconds off of their times to add to their competitive advantage. Typically they are high networth individuals and are extremely price inelastic.

### Fleets

Commercial bus drivers for City Transit Systems i.e. TransLink manage considerable vehicle and cargo sizes, constantly engaging their blind spots is a burdensome task. They rely on dated mirrors and have a demonstrated shortage of awareness in their blind spots at the rear. While the users are the bus drivers, the buyers are their respective provincial governments thus providing incentives to invest in Canadian Economy but will go to great lengths to provide more safety to their constituents.

### Tier 1 Supplier

Tier 1 suppliers source and compile interior “pods” for large scale car manufacturers. They source the electronic equipment and other car parts from smaller OEM manufacturers (i.e. Focus) and implement all into a “pod”, where they are then designed and worked into future car models. Working with Tier 1 Suppliers will allow our products to sold to North American car owners who suffer from presbyopia. These people will enjoy novel technologies and are willing to pay a premium price for a product demonstrated at making a marked impact on safety. Typically, these people will be in large suburban areas surrounding metropolitan cities thus are invested in their driving experience. They serve as both the economic buyer and the users.

## Revenue Model + Pricing

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/l89nqXmNg7ZcSM9vCqFZAzmYdIwzckLniRurAZRD9J2hSQlpr5hb_V3heGGvmVmefOFbAMnsEuaBbdLkz3W9mC7k4YRKnSpcfjVQvFLLpXCE6AIomgZXwJceaW1u7lXpZinEHUgAnWAeuUcqSiuzXA)

Focus will be generating revenue from product unit sales. We have identified 4 separate channels we will be entering and competing within. Namely; we have our beachhead market comprised of several private racing series, the general aftermarket, commercial fleets within multiple municipalities, and eventually, selling to Tier 1 OEM suppliers such as Robert Bosch GmbH.

### Pricing

For the beachhead market the agreed upon price of the initial product is set at $15,000 per unit. The price point has been validated as a competitive target by drivers within the Ferrari Challenge Series.

The general market price tag is currently set at $1199. The $1199 price points stands in the mid to high end on the price-spectrum of similar products currently available on the market. This price level has been validated with our general market customer via primary and secondary market research.

For Commercial Fleets and Tier 1 suppliers, due to the sheer size of the purchase orders there will be fleet prices established. Currently, our initial estimate is a unit price to be at ~20% discount from our general market pricing solution ($1000/unit).

Over the first 5 years of operating, Costs of Goods Sold and R&D are the largest spending activities for Focus, accounting for 53% of total revenue. Sales and marketing are a vital aspect of the Focus operation, taking up ~23% of total revenue in year five. Operating and G&A costs take up less than 10% of our total revenues.  For further a per unit cost breakdown, see Appendix VI.

## Financials

### Financial Outlook Overview:

- Focus is projected to be net cash positive in Q2 of 2023, the 5th year of operations.
- In the first 1.5 years of operations, revenue is coming from the beachhead market. Q3 of 2020 marks a substantial increase in revenue growth, as a result of entering the car auto-parts aftermarket. In Q3 of 2022 Focus begins its expansion into commercial fleets.
- The Focus Sales teams will be negotiating with major Tier 1 manufacturing suppliers to incorporate our technology into one of their interior “pods” ongoing throughout our first 5 years but does not have a material impact in our current 5 year projections.
- Substantial cash outflow is planned. This is a expected trend for car parts businesses, with a large emphasis on R&D & marketing spend.

### Key Assumptions:

- Our projected conversion rate sees an average of 7-10%. The 10% conversion rate is due to the tight-knit community providing a strong word of mouth platform and investing heavily in direct marketing efforts.
- The adoption of our products in the aftermarket is facilitated through an extensive marketing campaign promoting the product at industry events, online advertising as well as Print and TV. Anticipated conversion rate is 2-4% for Focus website. With our affiliate marketing program in OEM garages we anticipate a 2.5% conversion from lead to sales.
- In FY4 Q3, we expect to have secured our first partnership with Vancouver’s TransLink system to augment their bus fleets with our technology. The first purchase order will be a probationary period. We plan to expand across multiple municipalities.

### Major costs breakdown:

- Seasonality may be observed when analyzing the Cash Outflows - increased spending in Q1 of each FY is to prepare Focus for the planned activities and development for each year.
- R&D is a major costs for Focus, required to continue innovating the product in the highly competitive environment. As of year 5, R&D constitutes the largest share of revenue spent.
- The early aggressive spend on marketing as we bring the new tech to the market and build awareness. As we mature, Sales and Marketing spend will be aimed at adoption.
- Headcount spending is high for Focus, as product development requires a high number of professionals, in areas like engineering, marketing and of course, sales.

## Channels

### Beachhead market

Purchasing power for this channel lies with the Race car drivers. After we secure homologation, we are then free to market to and pursue deals with each team to bring our units on board. Marketing activities will include paid promotion through several series catalogs and websites. Furthermore, we will have a significant boothing presence early on as we build a reputation and focus on direct sales activities.

### General Market

Sales to the general public will made through dedicated OEM garages and part distributors as well as through online sales. As a digitally native company, all of the marketing activities will serve as a funnel to our website where orders can then be purchased. In store purchases will be through our affiliate marketing program, where a percentage of sales will be given to shops per recommendation turned sale.

### Commercial fleet

Focus will be attending national transportation conferences and tradeshows to develop relationships within the mass transportation industry. Within Canada, Focus we will be selling our product to individual bus fleets and/or respective Provincial ministries servicing public transportation.

### Tier 1 Suppliers

The big win. Here, Focus will be selling units in shipments in 10,000’s to Tier 1 suppliers that develop interior “pods” for large auto manufacturers. Further outlined in our Go-To-Market plan.

Four main areas of our execution plan.

### Patent

Currently we will be applying for a patent to protect the intellectual property behind FOCUS. This patent will focus on the light collimation hardwear as well as our software.

### Racing Series Sales

After filing a provisional patent we will begin to attend racing weekends where we will be taking sale orders from the individual drivers.

### Fleet Negotiation

Beginning in quarter four in 2019 we will begin our approach into the commercial bus fleet market, where we will begin by targeting local fleets, such as local school buses and the public transportation Coastal Mountain Bus Company. We will then be expanding to Seattle and Calgary.

### OEM Negotiation

On rewarding of our patent we will begin the negotiation process with tier 1 distributor to eventually get FOCUS into the general market. This will begin with hiring a consultant in the area of automotive manufacturing, We plan to use our association and credibility gained in the racing series and commercial fleet industry to approach tier 1 suppliers for incorporation into a interior “pod” build.

## Call to Action

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3d5_JJn2qtTlvo1ZMuc6BuAO16-jFTstxHgB8r03s03FHl9vSp1KU0bQDwo24r4J_yG5dD3IPw_-u8y37wSwpGDjkhkvuQb9Ab0FBL9kUBtwzqHjxrboa96WVz75ctRvajHbPu9hV1wl3XoZ5yDhAw)

We currently have purchase intent, we’ve validated the core risk of our technology, and we’ve established partnership with a top-tier racing team. To increase our valuation and bring us to a state of generating revenue, we would need $950,000 to cover our expenses for the next 8 months. These funds will be specifically used primarily to develop a portfolio of intellectual property, fund technical research and development (including wages for engineers), and to support Direct Sales in the racing series market.

### Financial Outlook Overview:

- Focus is projected to be net cash positive in Q2 of 2023, the 5th year of operations.
- In the first 1.5 years of operations, revenue is primarily coming from the beachhead market. Q3 of 2020 marks a substantial increase in revenue growth, as a result of entering the car auto-parts aftermarket. In Q3 of 2022 Focus begins its expansion into the commercial fleets and in Q2 of 2023 marks the first substantial sale in the commercial fleet market.
- The Focus Sales teams will be negotiating with major Tier 1 manufacturing suppliers to incorporate our technology into one of their interior “pods” ongoing throughout our first 5 years but does not have a material impact in our current 5 year projections.
- Substantial cash outflow throughout the five year timeline is planned. This is a normal trend of car parts businesses, with a large emphasis on R&D & marketing spend.

### Key Assumptions:

- Our projected conversion rate sees an average of 7-10%. The 10% conversion rate is due to the tight-knit community providing a strong word of mouth platform and investing heavily in direct marketing efforts.
- The adoption of our products in the aftermarket is facilitated through an extensive marketing campaigns promoting the product at industry events, online advertising as well as through Print and TV leading to an anticipated conversion rate of 2-4% on our website. With our affiliate marketing program in OEM garages we anticipate a 2.5% conversion from lead to sales.
- In FY4 Q3, we expect to have secured our first partnership with Vancouver’s TransLink system to augment their bus fleets with our technology. The first purchase order will be a probationary period where they test and function the product. After 1 year, filling the rest of the fleet. We will expand across multiple municipalities.

### Major costs breakdown:

- The largest spending areas for Focus are R&D, this is required to continue innovating within the product due to the highly competitive environment, and cost of revenue. Seasonality may be observed when analyzing the Cash Flow Outflow - increased spending in Q1 of each fiscal year is to prepare Focus for the planned activities and development for each given year. An example of such spending may be new headcount or increased marketing spend ahead of entering the new market.
- R&D is a major costs for Focus, required to continue innovating the product in the highly competitive environment. Year over year spending on R&D is increasing, and as of year 5, the largest share of revenue spend is for R&D.
- Sales and marketing is a vital spending avenue for Focus. The aggressive spend on marketing and advertising is aimed at achieving product awareness and recognition. As the company and product matures, sales & marketing spend is aimed at driving product adoption.
- Headcount spending is high for Focus, as product development requires a high number of professionals, in areas like engineering, marketing and of course, sales.

As detailed in the Technical Report, the Focus display has clear freedom to operate with regards to existing patents. Additionally, there are several features of the Focus display which are patentable, most notably the ability of the display to adapt to different drivers head positions in real-time using light field display technology.

In addition to patents obtained in the US, Europe and/or China, Focus display technology is inherently difficult to reverse-engineer and poses significant barriers to competitors that must undertake large research and development costs to produce a similar functionality. Physical limitations on conventional optical systems composed of mirrors, lenses, or similar elements which produce far-focused effects suggest that light-field technology is unsurpassed in terms of image quality and compactness.

## Appendix IV - Business Model Canvas

### Major Pivots

- We originally started out planning on selling Focus only in the Ferarri racing series but soon learned that the business was far too small of a total available market and we would not be financially viable even if we completely captured the market. So we set out to validate this technology for use in the mass market, where we found a potential pain point of vehicle owners with presbyopia.
- Our next major pivot was that we realized adoption into the mass production automobile market would be dependant on gaining enough credibility and trust. Therefore we then decided that the best mode of action would be to penetrate into the racing series to have the technology validated in a high stress environment, then expand to commercial bus fleets in order to display our ability to manufacture the technology at a large scale. Only after that would we be able to target the tier 1 suppliers for integration into a mass production “pod” build.
