					I&apos;ve dipped my toes in a few different worlds â€” tech, startups,
					public service, and beyond. At UBC, I studied marketing and
					mathematics while working as a Research Assistant, conducting
					interviews and experiments. I co-founded a venture that didn&apos;t
					quite workout but taught me a ton. I&apos;ve worked as a marketing
					analyst with OneFeather, helping Indigenous nations run elections.
					Later, I designed a service line for the BC Public Service, addressing
					challenges faced by Indigenous youth in care. Eventually, I brought my
					technical skills to Microsoft.

					their lives. I&apos;m driven to create and sell things that are
					valuable to people.
